		<p>LinkedIn is an innovative technology company that redefines the way people search for jobs.  LinkedIn took social networking and put it onto a professional platform.  Since 2006, the number of LinkedIn users has grown from 20 million to 259 million.  This increase in number of users is a result of improved technology at LinkedIn.</p>
		<h3>Java Serverlet</h3> 
		<p>LinkedIn has used a variety of different servers as the backbone of their network.  It was difficult to find the type of hardware servers that LinkedIn uses, but LinkedIn has used many different software servers throughout their companyâ€™s history.  When the website was first created, developers used a basic Java servlet.  Servlets are used to extend the functionality of a web system and are used in building various web applications.  As the company grew and expanded, the quality of servers has grown along with it.</p>
		<h3>Application Servers</h3>
		<p>The first mobile application created for LinkedIn used Ruby on Rails.  Rails is a common open source web application framework that companies can utilize to develop digital applications for business.  The Rails website assists in writing the code necessary to create things like mobile apps.  They have different programs that show step-by-step processes on how to use code and create a customized application. </p> 
		<h3>Oracle</h3>
		<p>LinkedIn currently uses Oracle Database 12c as its primary utility server.  This increases server utilization by using multitenant servers at high density.  LinkedIn can use Oracle to store more information using less server space.  Oracle uses SPARC T5 servers to set up their multitenant model.  These servers are used in all Oracle clouds and have broken records for their speed. Many other Fortune 500 companies also make use of the Oracle databases.  </p> 
		<h3>Voldemort</h3>
		<p>For its main storage system, LinkedIn uses something known as Voldemort.  Voldemort is accessed with a simple application program interface or API.  Developed by LinkedIn in 2008, it serves over ten thousand requests per second.  Voldemort was one of the first open source or NoSQL systems of its kind.  This system is used because of its simplicity and it is scaled horizontally, making for a wider distribution to users. </p>
